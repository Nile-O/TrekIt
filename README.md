# Trek It, a mobile application that helps you plan your mountain trekking adventures. This Native Android mobile application provides users with information on each of the 100 highest peaks in Ireland, including their height and location. Users can track their progress as they complete each peak, with the app recording their completion times and providing a record of their achievements. The application was developed using Kotlin in Android Studio. Firebase Authentication and Firebase Realtime Database were utilized to reduce back end development requirements.
